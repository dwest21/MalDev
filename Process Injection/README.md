# Purpose

For this small project, I made a process injection malware. The whole point of this was to increase my level of understanding on how malware interacts with Windows APIs, and also to increase my investigative skills for process injection. A large part of what I coded was through external research (reading MSDN docs, YUCK!) and watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6EKDAKBXPs) video.
